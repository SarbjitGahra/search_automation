A python application that allows user to run google searches from command line. A user could input their queries in command 
line and top results will be displayed in individual webbrowser tabs. I used beautiful soup to read the html and web browser module. 
It was an interesting project.I definatiely learned a lot. Planninng to expand this project further.
